      <li>The goal was to create a single virtualized view of the electricity system through an aerial view imaginary using an image segmentation model.</li> 
      <li>I explored various state-of-the-art image segmentation models such as PSP-NET, ViT, etc., and combined the best of all in a single model to achieve production-grade results.</li>
      <li>I also developed a novel metric for the evaluation of the model's performance as traditional segmentation metrics failed to provide helpful indications of failure cases. While the new metric helped filter failure cases easily which was then improved through data augmentation techniques.</li>
      <li>GRAD-CAM and its variant were used to locate features in the image when the model failed to produce the correct output. This analysis helped improve the quality of the training and evaluation dataset.</li>

Matrix ComSec is a leader in Security and Telecom solutions for modern businesses and enterprises with 1M+ customers in 50+ countries. I was responsible for developing and delivering DL algorithms in SDK form. My major contributions are listed below,
<ul>
  <li><span style="color: #8f85cd; font-style: italic;">Face Recognition (FR) and Face Detection (FD)</span></li>
    <ul>
      <li>Developed FD algorithm to detect multiple faces in the image with a minimum face size of 30px.</li> 
      <li>Developed FR algorithm with 99.85 % accuracy on the LFW benchmark.</li>
      <li>Improved existing FR algorithm to identify people wearing a mask on the face with only 5% accuracy drop wrt to full-face model. It helped employees to mark attendance without removing their masks during the coronavirus pandemic</li>
      <li>Developed a Face Mask Detection model to identify whether employees are wearing masks or not when marking attendance to improve their safety.</li>
      <li>Developed CNN for a single RGB image-based Passive Face Antispoofing model to prevent fake attendance marking using a mobile phone or printed photo.</li>
      <li>Delivered all these features in a single FR SDK for RPi3/4, CPU, GPU, and Android devices with a maximum latency of 800 ms on the slowest hardware</li>
    </ul>
  </li>
</ul>
<ul>
  <li><span style="color: #8f85cd; font-style: italic;">Automated License Plate Recognition (ALPR)</span></li>
    <ul>
      <li>Developed a real-time Licence Plate Detection model which achieved 99%+ recall and 93%+ precision on the internal Indian vehicle test dataset</li>
      <li>Contributed to the development of the CNN model for Licence Plate Recognition using CTC Loss. We achieved 87% accuracy on challenging the Indian test datasets outperforming other commercial solutions by at least 15% and 98% accuracy on the OpenALPR benchmark</li>
      <li>Developed semi-supervised data annotation tool which helped us collect a labeled dataset of 30K+ images and incrementally improved the model's accuracy</li>
      <li>Designed ALPR SDK architecture for improving throughput by batching simultaneous requests into single inference. A myriad of inference engines such as TensorFlow, TensorRT, OpenVINO, TensorflowLite, etc. can be integrated based on hardware without modifying 95% of the codebase.</li>

<ul>
  <li><span style="color: #8f85cd; font-style: italic;">Seven Segment Display Number Recognition</span></li>
    <ul>
      <li>To handle a variety of color digital displays, a self-calibration algorithm was designed to run once to extract display-specific properties using KNN and an inference algorithm was designed to use these properties for recognizing digits in real-time using SVM.</li>
      <li>The algorithm was integrated into existing weighbridge vehicle management software for automating data entry of the vehicle's weight from the digital display through the camera. It reduced manual human intervention by 95% and introduced transparency in the whole process.</li>
